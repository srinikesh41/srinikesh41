# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m Srinikesh Singarapu!  
I'm passionate about software, products, and solving real problems using machine learning and AI.  

I love programming in Python and JavaScript frameworks, and I’m currently exploring computer vision, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and self-supervised learning to build scalable, and intelligent ML applications.

## 🏗️ What I'm Working On

- **Fishby**: A fishing charter marketplace, exploring how AI can personalize recommendations and streamline bookings.
- **Outdoorsy**: A camping application that uses  alerts and intelligent suggestions to help users find the best campsites in Ontario.
- Experimenting with agentic workflows and LLM-based automation to push the boundaries of GTM efforts
