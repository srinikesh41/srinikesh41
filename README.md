# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m Srinikesh Singarapu!  
I'm passionate about software, products, and solving real problems using machine learning and AI.

I love programming in Python and JavaScript frameworks, and I’m currently exploring computer vision, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and self-supervised learning to build scalable, intelligent ML applications.

## 🏗️ What I'm Working On

- **Fishby**: A fishing charter marketplace.
- **Outdoorsy**: A camping application that uses alerts and intelligent suggestions to help users find the best campsites in Ontario.
- **Computer Vision Fish Detection Model**: Real-time fish species detection for commercial fishing.
- Building agentic workflows and LLM-based automations with tools like n8n to streamline and connect modern software products.
